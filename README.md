# NBA-Playoffs-Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a NBA team will qualify for playoffs or not for the year 2013 based on previous years data.
This is a learning project for Supervised Machine Learning.
Linear Regression is implemented for predicting team and opponents Points, which in turn determines the number of Wins for the teams. Feature selection for linear regression is done based on statistics. 
Whether a team will qualify or not depends on number of Wins and the model predicts the playoffs qualification status with an accuracy of 0.75
